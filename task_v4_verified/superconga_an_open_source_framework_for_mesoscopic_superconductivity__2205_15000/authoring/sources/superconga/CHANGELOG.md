- Update dependencies (HighFive, doctest, Forge, Armadillo, jsoncpp).


## Version v1.1.0 (September 5, 2023)

### Improvements
- **MAJOR** Added AMD GPU support via HIP/AMD ROCm. SuperConga now runs on both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.

- Added frontend setup flag `--gpu-framework` to choose CUDA or HIP/ROCm.
- Added frontend setup flag `--float-precision` to choose which precision(s) to build.
- Changed frontend setup flag `--cuda-arch` to `--gpu-arch`.
- Print number of Ozaki energies to `internal_parameters.json`.
- Added a tool for adding Abrikosov vortices to order parameter read from file.
- Modify noise tool to also save config, making it easier to run/plot properly.
- Add options to control which quantities to save.
- Update container names with CUDA/ROCm versions. Add multiple versions.
